# Inheritence

Account - Base class
Savings Account - Derived class

An Account has a name and a balance.
A Savings Account is an Account and adds an interest rate.

Challenge is the following:

1. Add a Checking account class to the Account hierarchy
    A Checking account has a name and a balance and has a fee of $1.50 per withdrawal transaction.
    Every withdrawal transaction will be assessed this flat fee.

2. Add a Trust account class to the Account hierarchy
    A Trust account has a name, a balance, and an interest rate
    The Trust account deposit works just like a savings account deposit.
    However, any deposits of $5000.00 or more will receive a $50.00 bonus deposited to the account.
    
    The Trust account withdrawal should only allow 3 withdrawals per year and each of these must be less than 20% of the account balance.
    You don't have to keep track of calendar time for this application, just make sure the 4th withdrawal fails :)
